# CarPrice_analysis

## Overview  
This project analyzes how different factors affect car prices. Using a dataset with car specifications, we apply data visualization, feature selection, and machine learning to understand pricing trends and build a predictive model.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used is CarPrice_Assignment.csv, which includes details about various cars such as brand, engine type, fuel type, horsepower, mileage, and price.  

## Steps Performed  

### Data Preprocessing  
- Handled missing values  
- Removed unnecessary columns  
- Converted categorical data into numerical format  

### Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Visualized how different features affect car price  
- Identified patterns and trends  

### Feature Engineering and Selection  
- Removed irrelevant data  
- Selected key features for analysis  

### Model Building  
- Trained machine learning models for price prediction  
- Evaluated model accuracy  

## Technologies Used  
- Python for data analysis and modeling  
- Pandas and NumPy for data processing  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization  
- Scikit-learn for machine learning  
- Jupyter Notebook for running the analysis  

## Key Insights  
- Certain features have a strong impact on car prices such as brand and horsepower  
- The predictive model helps estimate car prices based on car specifications
