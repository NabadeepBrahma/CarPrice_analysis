# Car Price Analysis

## **Overview**  
This project explores how different factors influence car prices. Using data visualization and correlation analysis, it identifies key features that affect car pricing. The goal is to understand trends and generate insights based on the dataset.  

## Dataset
The dataset used is **CarPrice_Assignment.csv**, which includes details about various cars such as:  
- **Brand**
- **Engine Type**  
- **Fuel Type**  
- **Horsepower**  
- **Mileage**  
- **Price**  

## **Steps Performed**  

### **1. Data Preprocessing**  
- Checked for missing values  
- Removed unnecessary columns  
- Converted categorical data into numerical format  

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis**  
- Visualized relationships between features and car prices  
- Identified correlations using heatmaps and pairplots  

### **3. Feature Engineering and Selection**  
- Removed redundant and highly correlated columns  
- Selected key attributes for better insights  

### **4. Data Analysis and Insights**  
- Analyzed data using histograms, bar charts, and gradient representations  
- Explained the impact of different features on car price  

## **Technologies Used**  
- Python for data processing and analysis  
- Pandas and NumPy for handling datasets  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations  
- Jupyter Notebook for running the analysis  

## **Key Takeaways**  
- Certain features strongly influence car prices, such as engine size and horsepower  
- Feature correlation analysis helps in understanding pricing patterns  
- The project provides meaningful insights into car pricing trends
